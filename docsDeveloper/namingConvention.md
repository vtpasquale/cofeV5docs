The naming convention(s) used for CoFE development have been given insufficient consideration and have been applied inconsistently thus for. Iâ€™m using this opportunity to improve thing by picking a convention. The current codebase does not obey this convention yet.

The convention is modified from the Java convention suggested by [Sun Microsystems, Inc.](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-135099.html)
