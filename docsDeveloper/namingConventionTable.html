Try to keep your class names simple and descriptive. Use whole words-avoid acronyms and abbreviations (unless the abbreviation is much more widely used than the long form, such as URL or HTML).</td>

<td>Variables</td>
<td>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">lowerCamelCase</code>. Variables including class instances (objects) should be mixed case with a lower case first letter. Internal words start with capital letters. Variable names should be short yet meaningful. The choice of a variable name should be mnemonic- that is, designed to indicate to the casual observer the intent of its use. One-character variable names should be avoided except for temporary variables. Common names for temporary variables are <code class="highlighter-rouge">i, j, k, m, and n</code> for integers. CoFE class instances of user-defined classes are often the class name changed from <code class="highlighter-rouge">UpperCamelCase</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">lowerCamelCase</code>. <b>See exceptions for special variable names below.</b></td>
